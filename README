## UnifiedInference Library (HF-only)

This repo now focuses solely on Hugging Face via the tryAGI/HuggingFace client (v0.4.0). The library lives at src/lib/UnifiedInference and exposes a unified surface for text and image generation, with gated hooks for audio/video/music that default to NotSupported.

- Quickstart and examples: [specs/001-unified-inference/quickstart.md](specs/001-unified-inference/quickstart.md)
- Contracts and mapping: [specs/001-unified-inference/contracts/](specs/001-unified-inference/contracts)

Basic usage sketch (text):

```csharp
using UnifiedInference;
using UnifiedInference.Abstractions;
using UnifiedInference.Factory;

var http = new HttpClient();
var client = InferenceClientFactory.Create(
    apiKey: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("HF_TOKEN")!,
    httpClient: http
);

var text = await client.GenerateTextAsync(
    new TextRequest
    {
        ModelId = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct",
        Prompt = "Hello world",
        Settings = new GenerationSettings { Temperature = 0.7f, MaxNewTokens = 128 }
    },
    CancellationToken.None
);
Console.WriteLine(text.Text);
```
