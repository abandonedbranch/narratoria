# Narratoria

A work in progress app for an AI-backed narrative driven storyteller and game master.

## UnifiedInference Library (HF-only)

This repo now focuses solely on Hugging Face via the tryAGI/HuggingFace client (v0.4.0). The library lives at src/lib/UnifiedInference and exposes a unified surface for text and image generation, with gated hooks for audio/video/music that default to NotSupported.

- Quickstart and examples: [specs/001-unified-inference/quickstart.md](specs/001-unified-inference/quickstart.md)
- Contracts and mapping: [specs/001-unified-inference/contracts/](specs/001-unified-inference/contracts)

Basic usage sketch (text):

```csharp
using UnifiedInference;
using UnifiedInference.Abstractions;
using UnifiedInference.Factory;

var http = new HttpClient();
var client = InferenceClientFactory.Create(
    apiKey: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("HF_TOKEN")!,
    httpClient: http
);

## Branch: narrator-skills 🧑‍💻

This branch explores implementing agent skills rather than a pipeline. The focus shifts from a pipeline-based architecture to a skills-based approach where agents can utilize specific capabilities to accomplish tasks.
