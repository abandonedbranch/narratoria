# World Overview: The Challenge Tower

## Setting

A mysterious tower exists in a timeless pocket of magic, accessible only to those deemed worthy by Leory. The tower contains a series of rooms, each with its own unique challenge. Time moves strangely here—passage of hours might feel like days, or seconds like minutes. The tower is neither cruel nor kind; it is *intentional*.

## Logic & Rules

The tower operates by an inscrutable but fair logic:
- **Entry**: Only those Leory invites may enter
- **Progression**: Each room must be completed to unlock the next
- **Failure States**: Failing a challenge locks it for a time; success opens the path forward
- **Time Dilation**: Standard temporal rules do not apply
- **Persistence**: What you carry remains; what you learn compounds

## Thematic Tone

**Atmosphere**: Mystery, introspection, subtle unease  
**Aesthetic**: Stone and shadow; symbols that mean more than they appear; a place of *deliberate* design  
**Emotional Arc**: Confidence → Unease → Acceptance/Defiance → Integration

The campaign tests not just combat prowess or puzzle-solving, but integrity, creativity, and growth. Challenges reveal character. Leory's motives remain unknowable: Is he pedagogue? Adversary? Both simultaneously?
