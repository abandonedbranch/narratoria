# Key Locations\n\n## The Challenge Tower\n\n**Semantic Role**: Primary setting  \n**Accessibility**: Timeless pocket realm, invitation-only\n\nA structure of indeterminate height, built from dark stone that seems to absorb light. Rooms connect non-Euclideanly—spatial logic bends. Windows reveal impossible vistas: sometimes stars, sometimes the same room from different angles, sometimes colors that have no names.\n\nThe tower *feels* deliberate. Every symbol, every architectural choice echoes intent.\n\n## The Entrance Vestibule\n\n**Challenge**: First Trial (Logic Puzzle)\n\nA circular chamber of cold stone. At its far end, an ornate door bearing symbols—ancient, elegant, holding meaning just beyond comprehension. Here Leory first appears to the player, offering the barest hint of what is to come.\n\n## The Rooms (Variable)\n\nEach room is unique:\n- **Thematic Consistency**: Challenges test different facets of character (problem-solving, courage, creativity, integrity, sacrifice)\n- **Difficulty Scaling**: Early rooms build confidence; middle rooms sow doubt; final room synthesizes everything\n- **Aesthetic Variety**: Each room has its own visual and emotional signature\n\nAuthor's note: Phi-4-mini will generate room descriptions and challenges that honor this framework while creating fresh variations.\n
