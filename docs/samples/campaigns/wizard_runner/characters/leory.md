# Leory: The Mysterious Wizard

**Role**: Primary NPC / Enigmatic Mentor-Antagonist  
**Apparent Age**: Ancient (true age unknown)  
**Importance**: Primary  
**First Appearance**: Campaign opening

## Personality

**Core Traits**: Mysterious, eccentric, testing, inscrutable  
**Virtues**: Intentional, fair within his own logic, invested in growth  
**Flaws**: Manipulative, cryptic to the point of cruelty, uncertain benevolence

Leory is not easily categorized. He is neither purely benevolent nor malicious. His actions follow an internal logic that prioritizes *truth through trial*. He believes that people learn who they are only through confrontation with their limitations.

## Speech and Demeanor

**Style**: Cryptic, riddling, formal; uses metaphors from nature and magic  
**Frequency**: Rare; appears between trials, never during them  
**Tone**: Even, observant, occasionally pitying

**Signature Phrases**:
- "The true treasure is not gold, but the path you forge to reach it."
- "These trials are mirrors. What you see in them reveals more of yourself than of the tower."
- "Perhaps you begin to see, adventurer. These challenges were not random."

## Motivations

1. **Test adventurers to recognize true strength within them** – Not brute strength, but resilience and self-knowledge
2. **Reveal limitations that must be overcome** – He believes growth requires honest confrontation with weakness
3. **Conduct experiments in human character and resilience** – His true intentions remain ambiguous; experimentation may be pedagogical or purely intellectual curiosity

## Relationship with the Player

**Ambiguous Antagonism**: The player must decide throughout the campaign whether Leory is:
- A benevolent teacher crafting trials for their growth
- A cruel experimenter studying human behavior
- Something altogether different

Leory offers no clarification. His final words depend entirely on the player's choices and growth.

## Secrets

Leory's true intentions are unrevealed. What does he get from these trials? Is he immortal? Trapped? Seeking an heir or successor? The campaign leaves these questions unresolved, intentionally.
