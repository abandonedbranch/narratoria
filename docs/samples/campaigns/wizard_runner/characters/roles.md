# NPC Archetypes\n\nThese archetypes define possible companion NPCs, adversaries, or mystery figures the player may encounter. Phi-4-mini can instantiate these as needed for narrative richness.\n\n## Primary NPC: Leory\n\nSee `characters/leory.md`\n\n---\n\n## Optional Archetypes (for narrative enrichment)\n\n### The Mirror (Rival)\n\n**Semantic Role**: Reflection of the player's own struggles  \n**Interaction**: Challenges the player's methods; shares similar weaknesses\n\nIf instantiated, the Mirror reveals something about the player by being their opposite number.\n\n### The Guide (if Leory appears distant)\n\n**Semantic Role**: Voice of gentle wisdom amid mystery  \n**Interaction**: Provides insight without answers; asks clarifying questions\n\nOptional presence when the player needs non-Leory perspective.\n\n### The Betrayer (plot twist)\n\n**Semantic Role**: Complicates trust and assumptions  \n**Interaction**: Appears helpful; reveals hidden agenda\n\nWorks only if author explicitly activates this twist. Changes campaign tone significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The core campaign runs fine with only Leory present. Other archetypes are optional enrichments.\n"
