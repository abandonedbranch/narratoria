# Game Mechanics: Challenge System\n\n## Challenge Progression\n\nThe campaign follows a structured but flexible progression:\n\n**Phase 1: Confidence (Scenes 1-5)**  \n- 1-2 early challenges, designed to build capability and confidence\n- Success should feel *earned* but achievable\n- Introduces the challenge archetypes (puzzle, courage, agility)\n\n**Phase 2: Complexity (Scenes 6-12)**  \n- 4-6 mid-campaign challenges\n- Combine multiple archetypes; increase difficulty\n- *Critical*: Pattern recognition begins—player notices trials target specific weaknesses\n  \n**Phase 3: revelation (Scenes 13-15)**  \n- 1-2 challenges during the \"Betrayal\" beat\n- These may be deliberately made easier to confirm the pattern\n- Player chooses: Accept, Defy, or Avoid the implication\n\n**Phase 4: Integration (Scenes 16-20)**  \n- The final challenge synthesizes all archetypes\n- Difficulty determined by player's Act 2 choice\n- Multiple valid solutions exist\n\n---\n\n## Success & Failure States\n\n**Success**: Player solves/completes the challenge; next room opens  \n**Failure**: Challenge is locked for a time; player may retry or seek alternative approach  \n**Critical Failure**: Challenge teaches a lesson; player gains insight even in defeat\n\n---\n\n## Resource Management (Optional)\n\nAuthors may optionally define resources (mana, health, equipment) that carry across rooms. Phi-4-mini can track these through state patches if enabled. Otherwise, narrative resource scarcity suffices.\n\n---\n\n## Difficulty Scaling\n\nAuthor defines a difficulty framework; Phi-4-mini varies challenges within that framework:\n\n- **Low**: Puzzle-heavy, combat light, time-generous\n- **Medium**: Balanced mix; moderate time pressure\n- **High**: Combat-heavy, complex puzzles, high consequence\n- **Adaptive**: Difficulty adjusts based on player performance (optional)\n\n---\n\n## Victory Conditions\n\nEach victory is valid if it aligns with:\n1. The archetype's core tension\n2. The character's established methods\n3. The campaign's thematic arc (growth through confrontation)\n\nCreativity is rewarded. Narrative consistency is expected.\n"
