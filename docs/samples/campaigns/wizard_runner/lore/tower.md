# Campaign Lore: The Tower & Its Mysteries\n\n## Lore Chunk 1: The Tower's Origin\n\nThe Challenge Tower exists in a pocket of folded space—neither here nor there, but accessible to those whom Leory deems worthy. Its construction predates most record. Whether Leory built it, found it, or dreamed it into being remains unknown. The tower does not age; its stones do not wear.\n\n---\n\n## Lore Chunk 2: The Rules of Time\n\nTime behaves strangely within the tower. Hours can feel like days; moments can stretch into eternities. Standard temporal measurement fails. Some believe this is deliberate—that the tower stretches trials to their psychological limit. Others wonder if time simply *means* something different here.\n\n---\n\n## Lore Chunk 3: Those Who Have Entered\n\nAdventurers have entered the tower before the player. What happened to them? Some claim to have succeeded and claimed the treasure. Others vanished. A few returned changed, speaking in riddles themselves, as though Leory's cryptic nature had infected them. No reliable record exists.\n\n---\n\n## Lore Chunk 4: The Treasure's True Nature\n\nLeory offers the treasure as prize, yet hints it matters little. What can gold buy in a place outside the world? What use is wealth to someone transformed by trials? The deeper mystery: Is the treasure real, or is self-knowledge the only treasure that ever existed?\n\n---\n\n## Lore Chunk 5: Leory's Motivation (Speculation)\n\nWhy does he run these trials? Is he:\n- A pedagogue believing growth requires ordeal?\n- A lonely immortal seeking conversation with worthy seekers?\n- A scientist studying human psychology through extreme conditions?\n- Something altogether inhuman, following logic mortals cannot comprehend?\n\nLeory has never said. His silence may be the trial's core.\n\n---\n\n## Lore Chunk 6: The Tower's Signature\n\nEverything in the tower feels *designed*. Symbols carry meaning. Colors are precisely chosen. Distances feel significant. This is not accident; it is authorship. The tower has an author—Leory or something else—and that authorship extends even to the trials themselves.\n"
