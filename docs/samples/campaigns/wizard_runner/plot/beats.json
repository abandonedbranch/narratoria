# Story Beats

## Act 1: The First Trial (Scenes 1-5)

**Title**: Entry & Confidence  
**Trigger**: Campaign start  
**Core Challenge**: Logic puzzle blocking the tower entrance

You enter a stone vestibule. Before you, an ornate door bears symbols arranged in an intricate, cold pattern. Leory's voice drifts from shadow: *"The tower answers only to those who understand its language."* The puzzle tests pattern recognition and lateral thinking—your first real test.

**Outcomes**:
- **Success** (~70%): "The symbols align. The door slides open, and ahead lies the tower proper."
- **Struggle** (~20%): "Minutes pass before insight strikes. You push through, confident but humbled."
- **Stuck** (~10%): "Leory observes from shadow: *'The answer was always there. You were not looking."* Hint offered; progress gained, confidence shaken.

## Act 2: The Realization (Scenes 6-15)

**Title**: Pattern Recognition & Unease  
**Trigger**: After 3+ completed challenges  
**Core Shift**: Player notices trials target specific weaknesses

Challenge after challenge yields to your skill. Yet something feels wrong. Each trial seems *calibrated*—designed not randomly but deliberately to expose your vulnerabilities. Leory appears between trials, offering cryptic observations: *"Perhaps you begin to see, adventurer. These challenges were not random."*

**Dialogue Anchor**:
> "Each challenge was designed to test something within you—a fear, a weakness, a limit you have not exceeded. The tower does not ask what you can do. It asks what you refuse to become."

**Player Choice Point**:
- **Acceptance Path**: Acknowledge the truth and consciously engage with your revealed limitation
- **Defiance Path**: Reject Leory's design and attempt to subvert the tower's logic
- **Avoidance Path**: Push forward without confronting the implication

## Act 3: The Final Confrontation (Scenes 16-20)

**Title**: Integration & Proof  
**Trigger**: After Act 2 choice  
**Core Challenge**: Synthesis of learned skills against peak difficulty

The final room presents a challenge that demands everything: puzzle, combat, agility, integrity. But it also offers a choice—victory through Leory's prescribed method, or victory on your own terms.

**Outcomes**:
- **Triumph** (~60%): "You stand victorious. The treasure chest opens, and within lies not wealth but a note in Leory's hand: *'You have proven what I already knew."*
- **Costly Victory** (~25%): "You claim the prize, but at cost. Leory nods, acknowledging the sacrifice required."
- **Pyrrhic Win** (~10%): "You succeed, but Leory's final words cut deeper than any blade: *'So you remain unchanged."*
- **Transcendence** (~5%, Defiance path only): "You discover a fourth path Leory never imagined. He studies you with something like wonder."
