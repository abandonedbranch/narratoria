## Campaign Format Creeds

This campaign adheres to the **Narratoria Campaign Format Creeds** for ethical AI-assisted authorship:

1. **Respect Human Artistry**: Generated content is a tool to accelerate creative work, never to replace human authorship. Human artists retain creative control.

2. **Radical Transparency**: All AI-generated assets are explicitly marked with a `generated` keyword in their metadata. You always know what was human-created vs. machine-created.

3. **Human Override**: You can refine, replace, or delete any AI-generated content at any time. Generated content exists to serve your vision.

4. **Attribution and Credit**: When campaigns are shared, generated content sources are disclosed (e.g., "NPCs generated by Ollama Gemma 2B on 2026-02-03").

5. **Preserve Intent**: When bootstrapping from sparse data, the LLM prioritizes staying true to your explicit input over creative elaboration.

## Customization

### Keywords

To customize semantic search keywords for any asset, create a `.keywords.txt` sidecar file alongside the asset:

**Example**: `art/characters/npc_wizard.png.keywords.txt`
```
# Keywords for the wizard portrait
archmage
merlin
protagonist
wise
mentor
```

When this file exists, Narratoria uses your keywords instead of auto-extraction.
