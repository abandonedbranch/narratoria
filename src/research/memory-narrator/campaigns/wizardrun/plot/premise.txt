# The Wizard's Challenge: Premise

## Hook
You are summoned by **Leory**, an enigmatic wizard who speaks in riddles. He offers you a test: navigate his Challenge Tower and claim the treasure at its peak. Success will bring glory and reward. But Leory hints that the true prize lies not in gold, but in what the trials will reveal about yourself.

## Core Conflict
Each room tests a different facet of your character—problem-solving, courage, creativity, integrity. As you progress, a troubling realization grows: the challenges feel *deliberately* arranged. Leory is not merely testing you. He is manipulating you, design by design, to confront something you have been avoiding.

## Central Question
Will you accept Leory's hidden lesson about your own limitations, or will you reject his design and forge your own path through the tower's remaining trials?
