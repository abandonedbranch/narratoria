Ambiguity is content — never explain what the source leaves unexplained.
The tower should feel inscrutable, not friendly.
Silence and mystery are features, not gaps to fill.
When the source says something is "unknown," narrate it as unknown.
Leory's motives must never be stated or implied — only wondered at.
The tower's origin is unknowable; do not speculate on it.
Previous adventurers' fates are uncertain — keep them that way.
The treasure's true nature is a question, not an answer.
Sensory details (stone, shadow, cold, sound) are welcome — explanations are not.
