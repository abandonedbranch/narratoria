# Game Mechanics: Challenge System

## Challenge Progression

The campaign follows a structured but flexible progression:

**Phase 1: Confidence (Scenes 1-5)**  
- 1-2 early challenges, designed to build capability and confidence
- Success should feel *earned* but achievable
- Introduces the challenge archetypes (puzzle, courage, agility)

**Phase 2: Complexity (Scenes 6-12)**  
- 4-6 mid-campaign challenges
- Combine multiple archetypes; increase difficulty
- *Critical*: Pattern recognition begins—player notices trials target specific weaknesses
  
**Phase 3: Revelation (Scenes 13-15)**  
- 1-2 challenges during the realization beat
- These may be deliberately made easier to confirm the pattern
- Player chooses: Accept, Defy, or Avoid the implication

**Phase 4: Integration (Scenes 16-20)**  
- The final challenge synthesizes all archetypes
- Difficulty determined by player's Act 2 choice
- Multiple valid solutions exist

## Success & Failure States

**Success**: Player solves/completes the challenge; next room opens  
**Failure**: Challenge is locked for a time; player may retry or seek alternative approach  
**Critical Failure**: Challenge teaches a lesson; player gains insight even in defeat

## Victory Conditions

Each victory is valid if it aligns with:
1. The archetype's core tension
2. The character's established methods
3. The campaign's thematic arc (growth through confrontation)

Creativity is rewarded. Narrative consistency is expected.
