## Campaign Description

A wizard named Leory invites the player to his Challenge Tower, offering trials that test problem-solving, physical courage, creativity, and moral integrity. As the player progresses, they discover the trials are deliberately arranged to confront their personal weaknesses and foster growth.

The campaign explores themes of agency, self-knowledge, and the nature of mentorship through ambiguity and mystery.

## Design Notes

This campaign is designed to work with the Narratoria prototype's 4-step narration pipeline and per-lens choice generation. The narrator flags enforce mystery and ambiguity as thematic elements, not narrative gaps.

Phi-4-mini should generate unique challenge variations while respecting the established framework and emotional arc of three acts: Confidence, Realization, and Integration.
