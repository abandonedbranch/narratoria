# Characters: NPCs

## Leory - The Wizard

**Role**: Primary NPC, Campaign Architect  
**Nature**: Enigmatic, speaks in riddles, motives unknowable  
**Appearance**: Ancient, cloaked, appears from shadow  
**Voice**: Cryptic, measured, hints rather than explains

Leory offers the challenge tower trials. He appears between contests, observing, offering cryptic commentary on the player's performance. His true motivation—whether pedagogue, immortal, scientist, or something else—remains deliberately obscure.

**Critical Note**: Leory's motives and the tower's origin must never be explained or fully resolved. Ambiguity is essential to the campaign's thematic weight.
